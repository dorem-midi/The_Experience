# The_Experience

The files contained here are the information for my virtual instrument The Experience. The sample files may be hosted somewhere else. I am creating this space to host information about how I made the Kontakt instrument in hopes that someone can translate it into SFZ format. Knowledge of how to create crossfades with modulation wheel, as well as making custom velocity and other controller curves in SFZ would be amazing.

Anyway, I will plan to post pictures of the Kontakt settings (curves, etc) in hopes that someone re-interpret the samples into another sampler platform.
